# Aug/2020. This code contains all the bead tracking tools developed by L. Welte. 
# Includes the ability to interpolate beads exported from XMA Lab, match the beads to CT positions and export transforms. 
# If you want to use the sphereFitToBeads, you will need to download the Mathworks function :

# Use the "RunMe.m" to determine beaded transforms.
